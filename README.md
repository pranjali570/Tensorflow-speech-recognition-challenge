# Tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge

The audio files were collected using crowdsourcing, see aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/open_speech_recording for some of the open source audio collection code we used (and please consider contributing to enlarge this data set). The goal was to gather examples of people speaking single-word commands, rather than conversational sentences, so they were prompted for individual words over the course of a five minute session. Twenty core command words were recorded, with most speakers saying each of them five times. The core words are "Yes", "No", "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "On", "Off", "Stop", "Go", "Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", and "Nine". To help distinguish unrecognized words, there are also ten auxiliary words, which most speakers only said once. These include "Bed", "Bird", "Cat", "Dog", "Happy", "House", "Marvin", "Sheila", "Tree", and "Wow".
